Exercises:

### Scope

* a *local variable* is only defined as long as you are in the function
* you can name a local variable the same as the function name

### Pass-by-reference

### Mutation

* Safe vs. unsafe methods. The bang, `!`, at the end of the method name denotes an unsafe method.
* The bang does not *always* mean the method mutates, but for our purposes, it usually does.
* Pay attention to whether you need to re-assign your variable, or mutate it in your function.
* Some Ruby objects are **immutable**, which means they cannot mutate. You must create a new and different object and re-assign your variable if you want to change an immutable object.
* Numbers are immutable in Ruby. `Array`s are **mutable**. `[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]` is an array with some immutable elements, and one mutable element. This could make a difference if you are iterating over elements of an array and changing them as you go.
