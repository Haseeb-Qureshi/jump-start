### Scope

* A *local variable* is only defined as long as you are in the function.
* Everything we have used up to this point is a local variable.
* Suppose you have a sequence of functions that call each other, and they all have a variable named `count`. That will be a *different* variable in every function. Their values will not affect each other.
* Even weirder, you can name a local variable the same as the function name. It is fairly common to give the same name to both the function and the variable that it returns:

```
def first_n_primes(n)
  first_n_primes = []
  ...
    first_n_primes << maybe_prime
  ...

  first_n_primes  
end
```

* The opposite of a local variable is a global variable. Global variables begin with the `$` character, and essentially should *never be used*. That variable will be accessible everywhere, and muddle your code. You want *modular* code, not *muddled* code.

### Pass-by-reference

* When you call a function with parameters, you are *passing* those parameters to the function
* There are essentially two ways of passing parameters: by **value** and by **reference**.
* Pass-by-value means make a copy of the value for the function, so that it does not affect the original if the function mutates it.
* Pass-by-reference means the function gets a reference to the variable you passed. If you change the variable in the function, the original will be changed.


### Mutation

* Safe vs. unsafe methods. The bang, `!`, at the end of the method name denotes an unsafe method.
* The bang does not *always* mean the method mutates, but for our purposes, it usually does.
* Pay attention to whether you need to re-assign your variable, or mutate it in your function.
* Some Ruby objects are **immutable**, which means they cannot mutate. You must create a new and different object and re-assign your variable if you want to change an immutable object.
* Numbers are immutable in Ruby. `Array`s are **mutable**. `[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]` is an array with some immutable elements, and one mutable element. This could make a difference if you are iterating over elements of an array and changing them as you go.
