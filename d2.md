# Lesson Plan

## Intro to programming (continued)

### Review

### Code style

* Indent appropriately
* Know the conventions for your programming language
* Keep your code DRY
* Single responsibility principle
* [Many more](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531)

Exericses:

* fix any style problems in the following code

```
def  hello_world
puts "Hello, world!" end
```

### Reading a stack trace



### Subarrays

* You can reference subarrays using a range
* Or using a start and end point

### Ranges

* ranges cannot go down
* use step to go up by more than one
* use to_a to convert to an array

### Enumerable methods

* each
* map
* any?
* all?

Exercises:

* print each element of an array
* double each element of an array of integers
* write a function to check whether an array on integers contains zero.
* check to see if every element of an array is zero


### Function decomposition

### Hash Maps

* For now, think, "array, but you can use keys other than integers in order starting from zero."


Exercises:

### Scope

* a *local variable* is only defined as long as you are in the function
* you can name a local variable the same as the function name

### Pass-by-reference

### Mutation

* Safe vs. unsafe methods. The bang, `!`, at the end of the method name denotes an unsafe method.
* The bang does not *always* mean the method mutates, but for our purposes, it usually does.
* Pay attention to whether you need to re-assign your variable, or mutate it in your function.
* Some Ruby objects are **immutable**, which means they cannot mutate. You must create a new and different object and re-assign your variable if you want to change an immutable object.
* Numbers are immutable in Ruby. `Array`s are **mutable**. `[1,2,3,[4,5,6],7]` is an array with some immutable elements, and one mutable element. This could make a difference if you are iterating over elements of an array and changing them as you go.
