# Lesson Plan

## Intro to programming (continued)

### Review

### Code style
* Indent appropriately
* Snake case
* Spacesâ€”let your code breathe!
* Know the conventions for your programming language
* Keep your code DRY
* Single responsibility principle
* [Many more](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531)

Exercises:

* The below is valid and correct Ruby. However, the style sucks. See if you can fix the style problems and variable naming.

```ruby
def  hello_world
puts "Hello, world!" end
```

```ruby
def is_prime num
n = 2
while n < num
    if (num%n==0)
      return (false)
    end
    n = n + 1
  end
  return true
end
```


### Reading a stack trace
Too many `end`s:
```
unexpected keyword_end, expecting end-of-input
```

Typo or out of scope variable:
```
NameError: undefined local variable or method `n' for main:Object
```

You got a `nil` where you didn't expect one:
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass
```

Incorrect method name (or method doesn't exist):
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `reverse' for 45:Fixnum
```

Always follow the line numbers! Stack traces don't lie.
```
NoMethodError: undefined method `capitalize' for nil:NilClass
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:18:in `greet_user'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:14:in `third'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:10:in `second'
	from /home/appacademy/projects/tmp/test.rb:4:in `first'
	from (irb):41
	from :0
```

### Advanced arrays
* Initializing arrays: `Array.new(20, 0)` creates an array of twenty `0`s. => `Array.new(size, default_value)`
* You don't just have to index one element, you can index a range of elements!
* `arr[0..10]` (two dots) gives you all of the elements from `0` to and including `10` (the 11th element)
* `arr[0...10]` (three dots) gives you up to BUT NOT INCLUDING `arr[10]`.
* You can index from any start and end index within the range.
* You can even use negative indices! `arr[4..-1]`

Exercises:
  * Initialize an array of 100 elements with a default value of `"yes"`, and then set every other value to `"no"`.
  * Now take that array and `puts` the subarray of only the first 10 elements (don't over-index!)
  * Then `puts` the last 10 elements.

### Ranges
* Defined in parentheses, just like subarrays: `(0..4)` or `(20...100)`
* Ranges can only go up
* Use `#to_a` to convert to an array
* Can also use characters! Watch your quotation marks though.

Exercises:
  * `puts` an array of all of the numbers between 30 and 50, inclusive.
  * Write a function called `letters_before(char)` that given a character in the alphabet, returns all of the characters that go before it in the alphabet.
  * Write a function called `to_range(arr)` that given an ordered array of every value from `n` to `m`, returns the corresponding range.
    * For example, the `to_range([4, 5, 6, 7]` should return `(4..7)` as a range.

### Enumerable methods

* each
* map
* any?
* all?

Exercises:

* Print every number from 1 to 30 using `each`.
* Write a function called `triplify(arr)` which given an array of integers, returns a new array with all of the values multiplied by three.
* Write a boolean function called `zeroes?(arr)` that checks whether an array of integers contains at least one `0`.
* Write a function called `all_odd?(arr)` that returns whether all of the integers in an array are odd.
* Write a function called `squares(arr)` that, given an array of integers, returns an array of each number squared.

### Function decomposition
* Break down your functions into as small pieces as possible!
* Single responsibility per function
* This will lower your cognitive load


### Hash Maps `{}`
* A.k.a., a dictionary or a map
* Also can conceive of as an array, but with indices other than integers
* Initialized like so: `hash = {}`
* Hash rockets `{ 1 => "one" }`
* Hash keys are all unique
* `nil` values by default

* Important methods:
  * `hash[key]` and `hash[key] = val`
  * `#keys`
  * `#values`
  * `#each do |k, v|`

Exercises:
  * Write a function called `word_lengths(str)` that given a sentence, returns a hash of each of the words and their lengths.
    * E.g., `word_lengths("hello my good good pal")` should return `{ 'hello' => 5, 'my' => 2, 'good' => 4, 'pal' => 3 }`
  * Write a function called `uniq(arr)` that returns only the unique values in an array. (Hint: use a hash!)
  * Write a function called `greatest_val_key(hash)` that takes in a hash with any keys but only integers for values, and returns the key with the largest value.
    * E.g., `greatest_val_key({ "a" => 5, "b" => 6, "c" => 3 })` should return `"b"`

### Custom hash defaults
* Can change the default value using `hash = Hash.new(default_value)`
* Counts pattern! `Hash.new(0)`

Exercises:
  * Write a function called `most_common_number(arr)` that takes an array, and returns the number that appears the most times. If there's a tie, just return one of the tied people.
  * Write a function called `least_frequent_word(str)` that takes in a string, and returns the word repeated most infrequently.
    * E.g., `least_frequent_word('hi ho hi hee ho hum ho hum')` should return `"hee"`
